Project Title
Unified Competition Management Platform

1. Introduction

Across the country, thousands of competitive events such as programming contests, debates, Olympiads, hackathons, robotics competitions, and seminars are organized every year.
However, event information is scattered across multiple pages, social media posts, and university websites.
This creates difficulty for participants, organizers, institutions, sponsors, and recruiters.

To solve this, we propose an All‑in‑One National Event & Competition Platform — a centralized digital ecosystem for every type of competitive event in the country.

2. Problem Statement

Event information is scattered and difficult to track.
No unified place to browse all competitions.
No national leaderboard or long-term archive of events.
Organizers struggle to reach participants.
Sponsors and recruiters are disconnected from the talent pool.
Institutions lack an organized profile for showcasing events and accomplishments.

3. Project Objective

To build a unified platform where participants, organizers, institutions, sponsors, and recruiters can interact, publish events, join competitions, track performance, and access resources — all within one integrated system.
